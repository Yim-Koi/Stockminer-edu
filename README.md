# Stockminer web application

This project was a colaborative effort between Warren Borders, Hande Pehlivan, Peter Hope, Lirsen Myrtaj, Anil Patel and myself. 

We built an interactive, visualization platform to help users learn about different financial models and relationships. This project was written in Python using Streamlit framework. 

The actual web application is available [__here__](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dataminers/dataminers)<br>
Note : Error encountered. Awaiting communication to retrieve missing files. Planning to move the application to Git for better storage and maintenance.
